### Summary

This methodology outlines a historical Carbon Removal Claim audit process.
The intended result is to cause the transfer of NORI tokens from a restricted
to an unrestricted account.

### Motivation
... briefly describe why this nmp is needed ...


### The Historical CRC Creation Claim Audit Process

At least once each 10 year Project term, but not earlier than the
6th anniversary of the Original Project Registration date, the Supplier
shall commission a Historical CRC Audit Report.

The audit report must be completed by a Nori Whitelisted Validator.
Entities that provide verification services may also act as validators,
but may not act as validators for a Project/CRC stream for which they acted
as CRC claim verifiers.

_Note_: Others might suggest no earlier than year 7 or 8.

_Note_: funding for the audit report will be covered elsewhere

_Note_: Verification is for the more frequent "in progress" measurement
and maintenance of the project, Auditing is the "final" measurement
of project output.

### The Audit Report

The Audit report shall include a whitelisted third party estimate of the volume of CO2:

  * removed from the atmosphere

  * retained in the soil

These measurements will be taken from within:

  * the Project's boundaries

  * the [Project's timeline](NMP-???) <-- Jaycen: requisite definition in every nmp <type: project>


_Note_: Need to talk about timing and who pays for verification and auditing
Methods.  I have a bunch of ideas, but these need
discussion before finalizing.  Needs Discussion, first among
Norinauts and then with others.

### Impact of Audit on historical Carbon Removal Claims

A qualified audit report will reveal three potential scenarios:

1. a surplus of CO2 relative to historical data was removed and stored

   * this will trigger [additional CRC1 creation](NIP-???).

2. a deficit of CO2 relative to historical data was removed and stored

   * this will trigger [deficit settlement](NIP-???).
   
3. neither a surplus nor a deficit of CO2 relative to historical data
   was removed and stored
   
   * this will trigger [project phase closure](NIP-???)

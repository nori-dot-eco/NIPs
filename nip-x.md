This is the suggested template for new NIPs.

Note that an NIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your NIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `NIP-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

## Simple Summary
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the NIP.

## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation
The motivation is critical for NIPs that want to change the Nori market protocols, designs or behaviors. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the NIP solves. NIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new or changed feature and its source. The specification should be detailed enough to describe any affected Nori components, such as internal smart contracts or external API impacts.
  
## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature might impact third party infrastructure such as client APIs. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Backwards Compatibility
All NIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The NIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. NIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Test Cases
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for NIPs that are affecting core marketplace components or protocols that allow fluent participation and operation of all current participants or induce backwards compatibility issues. Other NIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

## Implementation
The implementations must be completed before any NIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the NIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.

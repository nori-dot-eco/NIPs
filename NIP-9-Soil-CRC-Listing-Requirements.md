## Soil CRC Supplier Pre-Listing And Preliminary Soil CRC Rating Requirements

### Summary

This methodology outlines the actions a potential Carbon Removal Claim ("CRC")
Supplier must take to register a Soil based CRC-generating Project on the Nori platform.
Once a Project is registered on the platform, the designated "Responsible
Person" (the "Supplier") is permitted to submit a claim to Nori,
instructing the Nori platform administrator to list verified CRCs generated by
the Registered Project for sale on the Nori platform for up to 10 years, subject
to complying with NMP-2, Recurring Annual Reporting Requirements.  During Year
10, the Supplier may re-apply for Project Registration for a subsequent 10-year
term.  Provide a simplified explanation of the project/methodology being
proposed.

### Establishing Project/CRC Ownership & the "Responsible Person"

A single individual, resident in the United States of America, shall be
designated the "Responsible Person" for purposes of communicating Project
details and listing verified CRCs for sale on the Nori platform.  The
Responsible Person must be the owner of the land on which the project is
executed, or an American resident to whom authority to represent the land
owner(s) has been formally assigned.  Proof of title to the project-affected
lands and/or any relevant assignments must be submitted to Nori as a
pre-registration requirement.  By registering a Project on Nori, the designated
Person Responsible, hereinafter referred to as the "Supplier", is obliged to
notify Nori of any changes in land ownership and/or assignments of the right to
act as CRC Supplier for the Registered Project in a timely manner.

### Establishing the Project CO2-Equivalent Baseline

As a pre-condition of Nori Project Registration, the Supplier shall establish the
Project's Original projected 10-year CO2 Baseline by registering with and
meeting both the land management practice and energy use reporting requirements
of a Nori white-listed model or soil carbon stock and flux simulation tool.
Suppliers are required to report both changes in land management practices and
energy use, for purposes of establishing the Project baseline. Note that most
simulation tools require Suppliers to report up to 15 years of [historical land
management practices](NMP-???) to establish the projected 10-year project baseline.

### White-Listing Requirements

For a carbon stock and flux simulation tool to be
white-listed by Nori, the owners/administrators of the tool must commit to
the equivalent of the following data privacy standard: The simulation tool
owner/operator/administrator will not use or share the land management and
energy use data the Supplier provides, except for the purposes the information
provider directly approves.  The land management and energy use data that is
used to establish the Project 10-year Projected CO2 Baseline will not be shared
with Nori or stored in the Nori blockchain.

### White-listed Soil Carbon Stock and Flux Simulation Tools

1. COMET-Farm, United States Department of Agriculture (Natural Resources
Conservation Service) and the University of Colorado.

2. ... potentially others ...

### Projected Baseline Verification

The Supplier shall provide the assurance of a whitelisted third party Verifier that
the land management and energy use data supplied for use in the carbon stock and
flux simulation tool is reasonable and accurate.

### Project CO2 Baseline Quality Rating

The veracity and reliability of the simulated Project 10-year CO2
baseline will be a function of:

  1. the number of years of historical land management
     and energy use data the Supplier is able to supply
     the simulation model administrator
     
  2. the accuracy of that data
  
  3. the current state of knowledge regarding soil quality and other factors
     affecting the ecosystem in which the Project is located
  
  4. ... potentially more stuff ...
  
Based on guidance from Nori, along with the information provided by the Verifier,
the administrator of the simulation tool will assign the Project Baseline to a
"data quality tier".  The Project Baseline will be deemed one of:

  1. Tier 4 -- high uncertainty

  2. Tier 3 -- moderate uncertainty
   
  3. Tier 2 -- low uncertainty.
   
  4. Tier 1 -- no uncertainty.
   
CRCs that derive from any Registered Project will be initially listed as
CRC1, CRC2, CRC3 or CRC4 depending on the Quality Rating that is assigned
by the administrator of the simulation tool in consultation with the Verifier.

### Registration

A Project has:

  * a designated Responsible Person

  * a Baseline Rating: a quality-rated original 10-year CO2 projected
    baseline that is approved

These are validated by a Model Administrator. This permits the project to
register on the Nori platform. The Supplier must maintain Project
registration in [good standing](NIP-???) in order to list CRCs for
transfer/sale on the Nori platform.

_Note_: a "Model Administrator" means a Nori whitelisted carbon stock and
flux simulation tool administrator.
